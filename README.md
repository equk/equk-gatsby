# Notes

Added a postbuild script to fix netlify cms as importing css in the cms component from `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms` causes CSS processing to run twice making CSS bundle twice the size & breaking deploys in netlify.

    error UNHANDLED EXCEPTION Callback was already called.

The postbuild script copies built css to `/admin/cms.css`
