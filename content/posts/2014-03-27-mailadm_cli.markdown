I decided to finally start uploading some of my postfix & dovecot email server cli tools.
I was thinking of extending it to have a web based frontend but for now it serves it's purpose for me so hopefully others will find it useful.

I have put it up using the GPLv3 license and am slowly pushing commits to show working of the code. (I am already using this on a few live servers and it currently has functions to add, remove & query emails, domains, aliases and also reset password using urandom generated 20 character string)

So far I have only pushed the initial commit which has the query functions.
