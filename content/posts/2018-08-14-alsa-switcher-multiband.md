<br />

This is a script I made in 2017 but have recently uploaded to github.

Script & Config to utilize a Multiband EQ and switch between audio devices from the linux CLI.

- [x] ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
- [x] LADSPA (Linux Audio Developers Simple Plugin Architecture)
- [x] mbeq (ladspa plugin)

Currently the script switches between a USB DAC & a USB Headset.

The USB DAC (speakers) has no EQ & the USB Headset has a Multiband EQ (based on frequency response graph).

## Requirements

- asoundconf
- ncurses
- dialog
- ladspa
- alsa-plugins
