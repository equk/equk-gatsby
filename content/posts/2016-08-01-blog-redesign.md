Welcome to my new blog.

I decided to change the site to golang as something different & as a learning experience.<br/>
I have kept some of the look of the old site but have changed the typography to make it more readable.

This site uses markdown and has quite a few new improvements over my old node.js backed site.<br/>
The main components used in designing the site were SASS with bourbon & custom mixins for fonts, npm for automation of tasks, livereload & coffescript.<br />
It features a grid system with responsive styles.
<br/>

- [x] featured image support
- [x] code highlighting
- [x] no tracking javascript
- [x] disqus commenting
