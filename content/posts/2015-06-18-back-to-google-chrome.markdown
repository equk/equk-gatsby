I have decided to go back to using Google Chrome & Chromium as my main web browsers again.
This follows on from my <a href="https://equk.co.uk/2015/05/24/firefox-vs-chrome/">previous article</a> where I noted font rendering was bad in firefox.

I have noticed more problems since writing the article.

The main problem is really font rendering which may not seem much of a problem to many but when you are working on website design & font scaling it's really annoying.
It is worse on Windows but it's even noticable on linux (<a href="https://equk.co.uk/2015/05/24/firefox-vs-chrome/">see comparison screenshot in my previous article</a>).

**Further Mozilla Firefox Problems**

* *flashplayer quirks (probably not really Mozilla's fault)*
* *video elements not working (HTML5 players)*
* *slow loading/rendering of content*
* *slowdowns on larger sites/pages (eg: steam + infinite scroll)*

Since posting the previous article <a href="https://twitter.com/firefox/status/607215412279795712/photo/1" target="_blank">Mozilla also added Pocket as a builtin to firefox</a>.

These problems coupled with the problems in the previous post really become annoying.
It's a shame really because I like a lot of things about Mozilla Firefox.

I will still be using Mozilla Firefox to test cross browser compatibility when developing webapps & websites (as I always have) but just feel it has too many annoyances to use it everyday.

I am also still using Mozilla Firefox on my Google Android mobile phone as it seems a lot quicker.
