After moving back to using Firefox I noticed my old windows firefox profile powershell script needed updating.

*The script previously used hardlinks due to the way Windows 10 handled pinning of applications.*

Fortunately this was fixed so hardlinks are no longer required.

This also means the script no longer requires Administrator rights as it only writes to user owned files.

## ü¶ä ffox_profiles_win

Firefox profiles with security presets & userchrome styles on windows

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to provide a way to create new firefox profiles with security & privacy settings already preset.

It also includes some style customizations using `userChrome.css`.

## Why Make This Script?

*Mozilla Firefox has a profile manager in windows but doesn't create shortcuts for each profile & expects users to use the profile launcher to select each time.*

This script creates profiles & shortcuts for each making it easier for users.<br />
It also uses the same preset settings & userChrome styles for each.

## Usage

Clone or download the repo

<a class="github" href="https://github.com/equk/ffox_profiles_win" aria-label="View on GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> ffox_profiles_win</a>

Edit `ffox_profiles.ps1` & add profiles you require to the `profiles` array

Optionally you may also want to change the `profilepath` variable (default is $mydocs\ffox_profiles)

Run the script

*The script creates shortcuts & opens folder so u can pin them*

Pin shortcuts for each profile to the start menu / taskbar
