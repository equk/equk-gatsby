---

I just uploaded a small tkinter python script I made for i3wm.
The script is very minimal and provides a small interface to shutdown/logout/reboot (might add suspend/hibernate).

Here is a screenshot of how it looks on my current config.
<p class="text-center"><img alt="tk_logout" src="/media/images/2014/Jun/tk_logout_07062014.png"></p>
The script is <a href="https://github.com/equk/linux/blob/master/configs/.i3/tk_logout.py" target="_blank">available for download at <i class="fa fa-github-alt"></i> github</a>.

To get the floating window you need to add the following to your i3 config.

	for_window [class="Tk" title="tk_logout"] floating enable, border 1pixel

If anyone has any suggestions or feedback, please leave a comment.
