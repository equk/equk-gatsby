This is a working example of a next.js app using state to render an array of images utilizing the virtual DOM.<br/>
The project also uses the `fetch()` api which provides asynchronous requests with the use of promises.<br/>
The design & layout is based on my previous vanillajs project `unsplash-js-search`.<br/>
My <a href="/2018/08/01/unsplash-javascript-search/" target="_blank">blog post for unsplash-js-search</a> has more information regarding design aspects & working with the unsplash api.

## Main Features

- [x] Stateful Components
- [x] Loading Feedback
- [x] Async API Requests
- [x] API Key Seperated Using `.env.local`
- [x] Conditional Rendering
- [x] Virtual DOM

## Requirements

### Getting an API Key

In order to make any requests you will need to <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers" target="_blank">signup to unsplash as a developer</a> & request an API key.

### Adding API Key to App

Add unsplash developer key to `.env.local` file in the base directory of the project.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_CLIENTID = "insert-api-key-here";
```

## Cascading Grid

I decided to improve the look of the image results with a cascading grid which places elements based on vertical space.

This allows the images to be viewed using the original aspect ratio.

*Cascading Grid Feature Added Apr 6, 2021*
