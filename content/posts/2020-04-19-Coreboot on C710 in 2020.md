In 2014 I bought a Google Chromebook in order to try `coreboot`.

<a href="/2014/06/18/new-linux-netbook/" target="_blank" aria-label="read blog post new linux netbook" rel="noopener noreferrer">üìù 2014 - New linux netbook - (Acer Chromebook C710)</a>

I have been running archlinux on the chromebook since 2014 using coreboot and although I have built new versions of coreboot I've never posted any updates.<br />
I originally used `seabios` as a payload but later changed to `tianocore` for efi.

<blockquote>coreboot is a project to develop open source boot firmware for various architectures.<br /> Its design philosophy is to do the bare minimum necessary to ensure that hardware is usable and then pass control to a different program called the payload.</blockquote>

## Building Coreboot

The coreboot build system has improved a lot since 2014 & the documentation is well written.

üìù <a href="https://doc.coreboot.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="go to coreboot docs" rel="noopener noreferrer">coreboot documentation</a>

I normally build a test image with the default settings & the `coreinfo` payload when setting up a new build environment (as documented in <a href="https://doc.coreboot.org/tutorial/part1.html" target="_blank" aria-label="go to tutorial in coreboot docs" rel="noopener noreferrer">the tutorial</a>).<br />
This allows you to test the coreboot image using `qemu`.

### Getting The Build System

Install tools required to build coreboot

```sh
sudo pacman -S base-devel curl git gcc-ada ncurses zlib nasm
```

Download coreboot source

```sh
git clone https://review.coreboot.org/coreboot
cd coreboot
```

Build the coreboot toolchain for x86 & x64

```sh
make crossgcc-i386 CPUS=$(nproc)
make crossgcc-x64 CPUS=$(nproc)
```

### Chromebook C710 Config

I uploaded my config to github to make it easier but you may want to use a different payload or make some changes.

Copy the downloaded `defconfig` to `coreboot/.config`

```sh
cp defconfig .config
```

Check settings using `nconfig` (or `menuconfig`)<br />
I use nconfig as it is easier to read & scroll options (`ncurses`).

```sh
make nconfig
```

You may also need to copy or extract some files from your system (eg: vbt).

### Building Coreboot Image

Once you have everything setup you are ready to build the firmware image.

```sh
make
```

You should see the build output.<br/>
If successful you should see the message below.

```sh
Built google/parrot (Parrot)
```

*Building Coreboot with the Tianocore payload can take a while.*

## Installing Coreboot Firmware

<article class="message is-info">
  <div class="message-body">
    The Acer Chromebook C710 has a hidden jumper next to the RAM slots which needs to be shorted out in order to disable the firmware write protect.
  </div>
</article>

You can find the jumper behind some tape on the right of the top RAM slot.

### Check Write Protect Status

Open shell in chromeos dev mode.

```sh
flashrom -p internal:bus=spi --wp-status
```

You should see `WP: write protect is enabled`.

If you see `WP: write protect is disabled` you are good to go & can skip the next step.

<em>Chromeos uses a custom version of `flashrom` with `wp-status` added.<br />
You can build it <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/flashrom/" target="_blank" aria-label="go to chromiumos flashrom" rel="noopener noreferrer">from source</a> if you want to check write protect in linux.</em>

### Disable Write Protect

Once you have the jumper shorted out, boot into chromeos dev mode.

```sh
flashrom -p internal:bus=spi --wp-disable
flashrom -p internal:bus=spi --wp-range 0 0
```

Verify the status

```sh
flashrom -p internal:bus=spi --wp-status
```

You should now see `WP: write protect is disabled`.

If you get an error on trying to set `wp-disable` you will need to check the jumper is connected ok & try again.

### Flash The Firmware

<article class="message is-warning">
  <div class="message-body">
    Flashing untested custom firmware can cause problems<br />
    Having a way to recover a bricked device is advisable before trying <em>(eg: Raspberry Pi + SOIC8 Clip)</em>
  </div>
</article>

<article class="message is-danger">
  <div class="message-body">
    To use flashrom in linux you will need to boot using the kernel flag <code class="language-text">iomem=relaxed</code><br />
    This is due to the <code class="language-text">CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM</code> linux kernel option (kernel 4.4+)
  </div>
</article>

Backup existing firmware (copy it to a sdcard or USB stick).

```sh
flashrom -p internal -r backup.rom
```

Write & verify the firmware image.

```sh
flashrom -p internal -w coreboot.rom
```

Now reboot the system & boot using coreboot.

You should see the splash screen with the coreboot logo (tianocore).

## Running Linux

I have various configuration changes for running linux on the C710 on github.

- [x] Synaptics Tweaks
- [x] Wifi Tweaks
- [x] Bluetooth Tweaks
- [x] Intel Graphics Config

I personally use Archlinux with `dm-crypt` for full disk encryption.
