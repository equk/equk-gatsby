## Conclusion

It seems the team behind Brave are actively adding tech features which are relevant to users & the future of the web.

The design of Brave fits with power users as it is much more minimal.<br />
Core aspects of the UI design don't stray away from what is considered normal making it more familiar to users.

Mozilla seem to be trying to reinvent the wheel with UI changes, even going as far as making the browser look like a web app.<br />
They also seem to be forcing things like DoH.
