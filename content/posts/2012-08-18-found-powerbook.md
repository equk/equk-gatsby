I was just clearing out some stuff and found this apple macintosh powerbook duo 280c.<br/>
It still works, not sure if anyone collects these sorts of things but might be worth something to someone?

It also has a dock, an external floppy drive, external modem, 2 batteries and a battery charging dock.

Some specs I could find:

It's the same model powerbook Kate Libby used in hackers the movie (1995).<br/>
Not quite as cool as the clear prototype that also featured in the film.
