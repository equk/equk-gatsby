title: Turn a netgear DG834G into a Modem
slug: netgear-dg834g-modem

You can get these routers for little money and they are perfect for sitting in front of a firewall system with little hassle. (perfect for cisco, openwrt, iptables, pfsense etc)

_this also works with DG934G routers as you can reflash them to DG834v3, loads on ebay branded Sky for *Â£5-10*_

All you need to do is access a hidden option screen.
Open up the configuration in a browser and change `setup.cgi?next_file=start.htm` to `setup.cgi?next_file=mode.htm`
You can then select Modem and Apply.

Now setup the firewall that is behind the DG834G to connect via PPPoE on port1.

Reasons for having this setup: stop double NAT, firewall has a real external IP, no more DMZ or invisible proxy.
