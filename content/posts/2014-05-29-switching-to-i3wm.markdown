title: switching to i3wm
slug: switching-to-i3wm/

I've recently switched to a tiling window manager, after years of using openbox I decided it was time for a change. I had previously tried dwm and awesomewm but wasn't ever happy enough to make the switch.
Then I found i3wm.

The keybindings are really easy to use and if you use the windows key it doesn't effect use of vim etc.
After some customisation and scripting I'm pretty happy with the setup.

I have i3wm + conky (with json wrapper) + dmenu.
Screen locking is done using xscreensaver using start+l (as it was with my openbox config)

Here are some screenshots of my full setup (2 x Dell P2414H Monitors).
