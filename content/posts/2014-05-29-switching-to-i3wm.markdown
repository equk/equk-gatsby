title: switching to i3wm
slug: switching-to-i3wm/
---

I've recently switched to a tiling window manager, after years of using openbox I decided it was time for a change.<br />
I had previously tried `dwm` and `awesomewm` but wasn't ever happy enough to make the switch.<br />
Then I found i3wm.

![i3wm_ss_05_2014](../../static/media/images/2014/May/i3wm_ss_05_2014.jpg)

The keybindings are really easy to use and if you use the windows key it doesn't effect use of vim etc.<br />
After some customisation and scripting I'm pretty happy with the setup.

I have i3wm + conky (with json wrapper) + dmenu.<br />
Screen locking is done using xscreensaver using start+l (as it was with my openbox config)

Here are some screenshots of my full setup (2 x Dell P2414H Monitors).
