<br/>This is a new project which is similar to the mailadm_cli tools but hopefully a lot easier to use.

The mail console idea should be an easier alternative to using arguments.
I'm also looking at the possibility of adding features like live mail statistics.
For now it has the ability of creating and deleting accounts, aliases & domains.

I will hopefully be uploading it to github once it has been tested (currently deployed on my work test server, will hopefully be putting it onto production soon).
