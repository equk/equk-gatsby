Phil Zimmerman, creator of PGP-encryption on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mk25" target="_blank">BBCNewsnight</a>. NSA & GCHQ "have never had it so good".

Thought this short video was pretty good at pointing out the flaw with David Camerons ~~& the Governments~~ current stance regarding encryption and security.

This shows David Camerons lack of knowledge & understanding (of technology).

**Update:** *Had to edit this as it seems the government actually employ competent people.*

Here is the reasoning for my update: <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/uk-briefing-tor-child-abuse-minor-role/" target="_blank">U.K. Parliament says banning Tor is unacceptable and impossible</a>

<blockquote>Banning online anonymity systems altogether is not seen as an acceptable policy option in the UK</blockquote>
