This is a small script which copies config / dotfiles to a repo and uploads the changes to github.

*I noticed a lot of people are using multiple symlinks to folders and configuration files.
I don't really want symlinks everywhere so decided to copy the files instead.*
The script is just a simple bash script with a few variables, it might be useful for other people so I have <a href="https://github.com/equk/linux/blob/master/scripts/dot_copy.sh" target="_blank">uploaded it to github</a> in my linux/scripts repo.
