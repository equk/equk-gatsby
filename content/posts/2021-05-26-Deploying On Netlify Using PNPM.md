After changing this website to pnpm I noticed netlify don't seem to officially support it.

There are a few issue tickets relating to this & the general idea seems to be to disable npm install then run pnpm install to install dependencies on a prebuild script.

- [x] Disable npm with `NPM_FLAGS = "--prefix=/dev/null"`
- [x] Run `pnpm install` pre build

There seem to be a few ways to implement this

- [ ] create netlify plugin
- [ ] add prebuild script to `package.json`
- [ ] add `pnpm i` on `build`/`prebuild` with `ci` check in `package.json`
- [ ] add `pnpm i` on `build` section of `netlify.toml`

<br />

I thought the easiest & cleanest way was to add `pnpm i` to `netlify.toml`.

```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "14"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--prefix=/dev/null"
[build]
  publish = "public"
  command = "npx pnpm i --store=node_modules/.pnpm-store && npx pnpm run build"
```

### Update 2022

Forcing npm to use `/dev/null` using prefix results in non-zero exit code.

```
npm ERR! code EEXIST
npm ERR! syscall mkdir
npm ERR! path /dev/null
npm ERR! errno -17
...
Build was terminated: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 1
```

A fix is to force npm to show version info with `--version`.<br />
This stops other npm operations & just gives cli feedback on version installed.

See the updated `netlify.toml` below.

```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "16"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--version"
[build]
  publish = "public"
  command = "npx pnpm i --store=node_modules/.pnpm-store && npx pnpm run build"
```

If you check the build log after these changes you should now see

```
8.15.0
NPM modules installed
```
